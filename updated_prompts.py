def move_one_ball(arr):
    """
    Write a Python function that determines whether a list of unique integers can be sorted into non-decreasing order by performing any number of right shift operations (i.e., circular rotations to the right).

    Requirements:
    - Input must be only a list of unique integers.
    - Return True if the array can be sorted with right shifts only; else, return False.
    - Raise an error if the input is not a list or contains any non-integer or boolean.
    - An empty list or a list with one element should be considered sortable.
    - The logic must correctly handle sorted, rotated, and unsortable cases.

    Parameters:
    arr (list): A list of unique integers.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the list can be sorted using only right shifts; False otherwise.

def pluck(arr):
    """
    You are given an array which is a branch of a tree, where each node is a non-negative integer.

    You will implement a function called `pluck(arr)` that finds and returns the node with the smallest even value, with its index alongside. The return value must be a list of the form `[smallest_even_value, index]`.

    Requirements:
    - If multiple nodes have the same smallest even value, return the one having the smallest index.
    - If there are no even values or the input list is empty, return empty list: `[]`.
    - The function must:
    * Only accept inputs that are lists of non-negative integers (also exclude boolean values).
    * Raise a `TypeError` if the input is not a list.
    * Raise a `TypeError` if any element in the list is not a valid non-negative integer (e.g., float, bool, string, etc.).
    * Raise a `ValueError` if any integer in the list is negative.

    Your implementation must be robust and include necessary input validation for type and value correctness.

    Input Validation:
    - Raise a TypeError if the input is not a list.
    - Raise a TypeError if any element in the list is not a valid non-negative integer 
      (e.g., float, bool, string, etc.).
    - Raise a ValueError if any integer in the list is negative.

    Parameters:
    arr (list): A list of non-negative integers representing nodes.

    Returns:
    list: A list containing the smallest even value and its index [value, index], or [] if no even values exist.

    Raises:
    TypeError: If the input is not a list or contains invalid types.
    ValueError: If the list contains negative integers.

    Example 1:
        Input: [4,2,3]
        Output: [2, 1]
        Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index.

    Example 2:
        Input: [1,2,3]
        Output: [2, 1]
        Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index. 

    Example 3:
        Input: []

    Example 4:
        Input: [5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]
        Output: [0, 1]
        Explanation: 0 is the smallest value, but  there are two zeros,
                     so we will choose the first zero, which has the smallest index.

        * 1 <= nodes.length <= 10000

    You will implement a function named `reverse_delete(s, c)` that:
    - Removes all characters from string s that are present in string c,
    - Returns a tuple (new_string, is_palindrome),
    - Where is_palindrome is True if the remaining string is a palindrome.

    Note: Both deletion and palindrome checks are case-sensitive.

def get_closest_vowel(word):
    """
    You will implement a function called `get_closest_vowel(word)` that returns the rightmost vowel in a word that is surrounded
    by consonants on both sides (i.e., the characters directly before and after the vowel must not be vowels).

    The function must:
    - Return the rightmost surrounded vowel (case preserved),
    - Return "" if no such vowel exists,
    - Raise TypeError if the input is not a string.

    Vowels are defined as: a, e, i, o, u (both uppercase and lowercase).
    """


def decimal_to_binary(n):
    """
    You are to implement a function named `decimal_to_binary(n)` that takes a non-negative integer and returns its binary
    representation wrapped in the string format "db<binary>db".

    Requirements:
    - Input must be a non-negative integer.
    - Raise a TypeError for non-integer inputs.
    - Raise a ValueError for negative integers.
    - The binary output should include only 0s and 1s and must be wrapped with "db" at both ends.

    Args:
    - n (int): A non-negative integer to convert.

    Returns:
    - str: A string of the form "db<binary_digits>db" representing the binary form of the input.

    Examples:
    - decimal_to_binary(0) => "db0db"
    - decimal_to_binary(5) => "db101db"
    - decimal_to_binary(255) => "db11111111db"

    Raises:
    - TypeError: If the input is not an integer.
    - ValueError: If the input is negative.

    Notes:
    - The binary conversion must preserve all binary digits exactly.
    - The output must include "db" at both the beginning and the end.
    - Invalid types such as float, string, list, etc., should raise an error.
    """


def intersection(interval1, interval2):
    """
    You are to implement a function called `intersection(interval1, interval2)` that determines whether two intervals intersect,
    and if they do, whether the length of the overlapping part is a prime number.

    Each interval is represented as a tuple of two integers (start, end). The function must work regardless of the input order
    (e.g., (5, 1) is the same as (1, 5)).

    Return:
    - "YES" if the intervals overlap and the overlap length is a prime number.
    - "NO" otherwise.

    Input Validation:
    - Raise TypeError if the input is not a tuple.
    - Raise ValueError if the tuple does not have exactly 2 elements.
    - Raise TypeError if any element of the tuple is not an integer.

    Args:
    - interval1 (Tuple[int, int]): First interval (start, end).
    - interval2 (Tuple[int, int]): Second interval (start, end).

    Returns:
    - str: "YES" or "NO" based on the intersection and prime overlap length.

    Examples:
    - intersection((1, 5), (3, 7)) => "YES"  (overlap is [3, 4, 5], length 3 which is prime)
    - intersection((0, 2), (3, 5)) => "NO"   (no overlap)
    - intersection((2, 2), (2, 2)) => "NO"   (overlap length 1, not prime)
    - intersection((5, 1), (0, 3)) => "NO"   (normalized to (1,5) and (0,3); overlap [1,2], length 2 â†’ prime â†’ "YES")

    Notes:
    - Input order does not matter. Normalize intervals internally.
    - Use standard methods to check for primality of overlap length.
    - Intervals include both start and end values (closed intervals).
    """


def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    """
    You are given a sentence containing words separated by spaces. You will implement a function called `words_in_sentence(sentence)` that returns a string containing only the words that have a prime number of characters.

    The output words must:
    - Be preserved in their original order from the input sentence,
    - Contain only alphabetic characters (skip any with digits or punctuation),
    - Be selected only if their length is a prime number,
    - Ignore any leading, trailing, or extra whitespace between words.

    Input validation:
    - Accept only string input,
    - Raise a TypeError for any non-string input.

    Returns:
    - A space-separated string of valid words meeting the criteria above.

    Examples:
    - words_in_sentence("this is an example!") => "this is"
    - words_in_sentence("  prime   digits123   okay ") => "prime okay"
    - words_in_sentence(12345) => raises TypeError
    - words_in_sentence("1two three4") => ""

    Notes:
    - The function should not modify words that pass validation,
    - Use built-in `str.isalpha()` for alphabetic filtering,
    - Consider 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc. as prime lengths.
